	The goal of this project is to find the quickest way to get n ants across the farm.
	
	At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is
to bring them to the room ##end with as few turns as possible. Each room can
only contain one ant at a time. (except at ##start and ##end which can contain
as many ants as necessary.)	


1) First enter the number of ants
** the value of ants must be only positive integers from 1 to 999999999 and no other symbols

2) Then enter the rooms in the next format: the name of the room cords-y cords-x.

** No space, -, L, in the name of the room.
** Rooms cord must be only positive integers.
** Lines that start with ## are commands modifying the properties of the line that
comes right after.
	For example, ##start signals the ant farm’s entrance and ##end its exit.
	Any unknown command will be ignored, but work of program will be continued.

3) The links, which are defined by: name1-name2
** No repeat links
** No incorect links
** No unvalible room in links

Not valid input will stop the reading data from input and if there isn’t enough 
data to process normally it'll display ERROR.

EXAMPLE

##end
1 5 0
2 9 0
3 13 0
0-2
2-3
3-1

BONUS PART:
./lem-in -way (will print all ways)
./lem-in -erm (will print full error message)
./lem-in --help (read short manual)

Good luck!!!
